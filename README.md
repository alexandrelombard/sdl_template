# SDL Template

Small project serving as a tutorial for using the SDL library in C.

It is divided in 4 items:
- **1_create_window.c**: shows how to create a window
- **2_manage_events.c**: shows how to read events from the keyboard
- **3_drawing_rects.c**: shows how to draw rectangles on the screen
- **4_pong.c**: mix the previous points to build a template to make a Pong game 

To make it easier to setup the SDL library is already included there.
